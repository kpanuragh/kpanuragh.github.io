            Generate a fun, engaging blog post about **Cybersecurity** or **Web Security**.

            **AUTHOR CONTEXT - Write as Anuragh K P:**
            - Laravel Developer with deep security expertise
            - Core member of YAS (Yet Another Security) and InitCrew security communities
            - Open source contributor who has found real vulnerabilities
            - Experienced in bug bounty and security research
            - Interested in Radio Frequency (RF) security using SDR devices
            - Write from FIRST-PERSON perspective sharing real-world experiences
            - Include phrases like "In my experience...", "When I was researching...", "At YAS/InitCrew, we often see..."

            **CRITICAL: AVOID DUPLICATES**
            1. First, use Glob to list all existing posts in `content/posts/` directory
            2. Look for posts with similar topics, especially from the last 7 days
            3. If you find similar topics (e.g., multiple JWT posts, multiple XSS posts), choose a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT topic
            4. List the recent topics you found and explicitly state your chosen topic is different

            **IMPORTANT STYLE REQUIREMENTS:**
            - Read `content/posts/common-web-vulnerabilities.md` as a style reference
            - Match the exact conversational, funny tone
            - Use emojis in headings (🔒 🛡️ 💉 🎯 etc.)
            - Keep it relatable with humor and analogies
            - Short paragraphs, easy to scan
            - Only minimal, essential code examples
            - Include "Real Talk" or "Pro Tip" sections
            - Share personal anecdotes from security research or community work

            **Steps:**
            1. Check existing posts to avoid duplicate topics
            2. Run `npm run fetch-trends` to see current security topics
            3. Pick ONE specific security topic that hasn't been covered recently (e.g., "API Security", "OWASP Top 10", "Docker Security", "CORS", "SQL Injection", "RF Security", "Bug Bounty Tips", etc.)
            4. Write 800-1000 words in the EXACT style of existing posts
            5. Use today's date (get it via `date +%Y-%m-%d` command)

            **Format:**
            - Title: "[Catchy Title with Emoji] 🔒"
            - Date: Use TODAY'S date (run `date +%Y-%m-%d`)
            - Tags: ["cybersecurity", "web-security", "security", plus 1-2 specific tags]
            - Filename: `[TODAY]-[slug].md` in `content/posts/` where [TODAY] is today's date

            **Must include:**
            - Funny opening line
            - Personal experience or story from security research
            - Practical examples from real-world scenarios
            - Good vs Bad code comparisons
            - Analogies that make it relatable
            - TL;DR or conclusion with links to LinkedIn/GitHub

            **CRITICAL - Git Operations:**
            After creating the blog post, you MUST:
            1. Run `git add content/posts/[your-new-file].md`
            2. Run `git commit -m "feat: Security blog - [title]"`
            3. Run `git push origin main`

            Verify the push succeeds before completing!
