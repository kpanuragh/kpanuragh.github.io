			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a passionate Laravel Developer who thrives on coding and debugging, constantly striving
				to turn challenges into opportunities for growth. Beyond development, I have a deep
				interest in cybersecurity and actively contribute as a core member of esteemed
				communities like YAS (Yet Another Security) and InitCrew, where I collaborate with
				like-minded enthusiasts to push the boundaries of digital security.

				An advocate for open-source, I love giving back to the community by contributing to
				various open-source projects, believing in the power of collaboration to drive
				innovation. When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll often find me exploring the
				fascinating world of Radio Frequency (RF) using SDR devices, blending my curiosity for
				technology with hands-on experimentation.

				Technology inspires me in every way—it’s a boundless world of possibilities that fuels
				my creativity and drives my curiosity every single day.</p>
