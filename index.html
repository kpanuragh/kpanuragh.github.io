            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate Laravel Developer who thrives on coding and debugging, constantly striving to turn challenges into opportunities for growth. Beyond development, I have a deep interest in cybersecurity and actively contribute as a core member of esteemed communities like YAS (Yet Another Security) and InitCrew, where I collaborate with like-minded enthusiasts to push the boundaries of digital security.

An advocate for open-source, I love giving back to the community by contributing to various open-source projects, believing in the power of collaboration to drive innovation. When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll often find me exploring the fascinating world of Radio Frequency (RF) using SDR devices, blending my curiosity for technology with hands-on experimentation.

Technology inspires me in every way—it’s a boundless world of possibilities that fuels my creativity and drives my curiosity every single day.</p>
