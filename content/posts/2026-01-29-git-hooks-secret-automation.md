# Git Hooks: The Secret Automation Living in Your `.git` Folder ⚡🪝

**Real talk:** I once pushed code to production with `console.log("TODO: remove this")` and `debugger` statements everywhere. My team was... not thrilled. 😅

Then I discovered git hooks. Now my computer REFUSES to let me commit stupid mistakes. It's like having a really judgy but helpful robot watching over my shoulder!

**The best part?** Git hooks have been hiding in every repo you've ever cloned. Right there in `.git/hooks/`. You just never looked! 🔍

Let me show you how to automate away all those "oops" moments!

## What Even Are Git Hooks? 🤔

**Think of them as:** Event listeners for git operations!

**The concept:**
```bash
You run: git commit
Git thinks: "Wait, let me check if there's a pre-commit hook..."
Hook runs: npm test, lint checks, whatever you want!
Hook passes: Commit succeeds! ✅
Hook fails: Commit blocked! ❌

# Automatic quality gates! 🎯
```

**Translation:** Git hooks let you run scripts automatically before/after git operations. They're literally built into git - no external tools needed!

**Why this is genius:**
- Catch mistakes BEFORE they reach the remote
- Enforce code standards automatically
- Run tests you'd otherwise forget
- Prevent embarrassing commits
- Make your team love you (or at least tolerate you)

## Where Do Git Hooks Live? 🏠

```bash
# Every git repo has them!
cd your-project
ls .git/hooks/

# You'll see:
applypatch-msg.sample
commit-msg.sample
pre-commit.sample
pre-push.sample
# ... and more!

# The .sample extension means they're disabled
# Remove .sample to activate them!
```

**The secret:** Git comes with example hooks! Just rename them and customize!

**Quick activation:**
```bash
cd .git/hooks
mv pre-commit.sample pre-commit
chmod +x pre-commit
# Now it runs before every commit! 🎉
```

## The Hooks You Actually Need 🎯

### 1. Pre-Commit: The Gatekeeper 🚪

**Runs before every commit. Most useful hook ever!**

**Example 1: Prevent debugging code**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check for console.log in staged files
if git diff --cached | grep -E "console\.(log|debug|info)"; then
  echo "❌ Error: console.log() found in staged files!"
  echo "Remove debug statements before committing."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ No console.log found. Committing..."
```

**What happens:**
```bash
# You try to commit:
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"

# Hook finds console.log:
❌ Error: console.log() found in staged files!
Remove debug statements before committing.

# Commit blocked! You have to fix it! 💪
```

**Example 2: Auto-format code**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "🎨 Running Prettier..."
npx prettier --write $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$')

# Re-add formatted files
git add -u

echo "✅ Code formatted!"
```

**The magic:** Your code gets auto-formatted ON EVERY COMMIT! Never argue about formatting again! 🎉

**Example 3: Run linter**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "🔍 Running ESLint..."
npx eslint $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$')

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ ESLint failed! Fix errors before committing."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Linting passed!"
```

### 2. Commit-Msg: The Grammar Nazi 📝

**Runs after you write your commit message, before commit completes.**

**Example 1: Enforce commit message format**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/commit-msg

commit_msg=$(cat "$1")

# Require format: "type: description"
# Examples: "feat: add login", "fix: button click"
if ! echo "$commit_msg" | grep -qE "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore): .+"; then
  echo "❌ Invalid commit message format!"
  echo ""
  echo "Format: <type>: <description>"
  echo "Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore"
  echo ""
  echo "Example: feat: add user authentication"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Commit message format is valid!"
```

**What happens:**
```bash
# Bad commit message:
git commit -m "stuff"
❌ Invalid commit message format!

# Good commit message:
git commit -m "feat: add user dashboard"
✅ Commit message format is valid!

# Your commit history stays clean! 📚
```

**Example 2: Prevent swearing (for when you're angry)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/commit-msg

commit_msg=$(cat "$1")

# Check for inappropriate words
if echo "$commit_msg" | grep -iE "(fuck|shit|damn)"; then
  echo "❌ Profanity detected in commit message!"
  echo "Remember: your future employers will read this. 😅"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Real story:** This saved me from committing "fix: this fucking bug finally works" to a client project. Crisis averted! 😬

### 3. Pre-Push: The Last Line of Defense 🛡️

**Runs before code is pushed to remote.**

**Example 1: Run tests before push**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

echo "🧪 Running tests before push..."
npm test

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Tests failed! Fix them before pushing."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All tests passed! Pushing..."
```

**The safety net:**
```bash
git push origin main
🧪 Running tests before push...
❌ Tests failed! Fix them before pushing.

# Can't push broken code! 🎯
```

**Example 2: Prevent pushing to main/master**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

if [ "$branch" = "main" ] || [ "$branch" = "master" ]; then
  echo "❌ Direct push to $branch is not allowed!"
  echo "Create a branch and open a PR instead."
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pushing to $branch..."
```

**Why this rocks:** Enforces PR workflow! No more "oops, I pushed directly to main" 💀

**Example 3: Check for secrets**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

echo "🔒 Checking for exposed secrets..."

# Check for common secret patterns
if git diff origin/main...HEAD | grep -E "(api[_-]?key|password|secret|token)" | grep -v "PASSWORD_FIELD"; then
  echo "❌ Possible secret detected!"
  echo "Review your code before pushing!"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ No secrets detected!"
```

### 4. Post-Commit: The Celebrator 🎉

**Runs after commit succeeds. For fun stuff!**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-commit

# Fun ASCII art on every commit
cat << "EOF"
    _____ ____  __  __ __  __ _____ _______ _______ ______ _____  _
   / ____/ __ \|  \/  |  \/  |_   _|__   __|__   __|  ____|  __ \| |
  | |   | |  | | \  / | \  / | | |    | |     | |  | |__  | |  | | |
  | |   | |  | | |\/| | |\/| | | |    | |     | |  |  __| | |  | | |
  | |___| |__| | |  | | |  | |_| |_   | |     | |  | |____| |__| |_|
   \_____\____/|_|  |_|_|  |_|_____|  |_|     |_|  |______|_____/(_)
EOF

echo "Nice work! Keep it up! 🚀"
```

**Because coding should be fun!** 😎

## Real-World Workflows That Actually Work 💼

### Workflow 1: The JavaScript Project

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "🚀 Running pre-commit checks..."

# 1. Format code
echo "📝 Formatting..."
npx prettier --write $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx|json|css)$')

# 2. Lint
echo "🔍 Linting..."
npx eslint $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$')
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Linting failed!"
  exit 1
fi

# 3. Type check (if TypeScript)
if [ -f "tsconfig.json" ]; then
  echo "📘 Type checking..."
  npx tsc --noEmit
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Type errors found!"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

# 4. Re-add formatted files
git add -u

echo "✅ All checks passed!"
```

**Result:** Every commit is formatted, linted, and type-checked! 🎯

### Workflow 2: The Python Project

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "🐍 Running Python checks..."

# Get staged Python files
PYTHON_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.py$')

if [ -n "$PYTHON_FILES" ]; then
  # Format with black
  echo "🎨 Running Black..."
  black $PYTHON_FILES

  # Lint with flake8
  echo "🔍 Running Flake8..."
  flake8 $PYTHON_FILES
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Linting failed!"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Type check with mypy
  echo "📘 Running mypy..."
  mypy $PYTHON_FILES
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Type checking failed!"
    exit 1
  fi

  # Re-add formatted files
  git add $PYTHON_FILES
fi

echo "✅ Python checks passed!"
```

### Workflow 3: The Security-Conscious Team

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

echo "🔒 Security checks..."

# 1. Check for secrets
echo "🔑 Scanning for secrets..."
if git diff origin/main...HEAD | grep -iE "(api[_-]?key|password|secret|token|aws[_-]?access)" | grep -v "PASSWORD_FIELD"; then
  echo "❌ Possible secrets detected!"
  echo "Review your changes carefully!"
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Dependency audit
echo "📦 Auditing dependencies..."
npm audit --audit-level=high
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  High severity vulnerabilities found!"
  echo "Run 'npm audit fix' to resolve."
  exit 1
fi

# 3. Run security-focused tests
echo "🧪 Running security tests..."
npm run test:security
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Security tests failed!"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Security checks passed!"
```

## The Modern Way: Husky + lint-staged 🐕

**The problem:** Git hooks aren't shared with your team (they're in `.git/`, which is gitignored!)

**The solution:** Use Husky to manage hooks in your repo!

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Install Husky and lint-staged
npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged

# Initialize Husky
npx husky init

# Create pre-commit hook
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
```

**Configure in `package.json`:**

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ],
    "*.{json,css,md}": [
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

**What just happened:**
- Husky stores hooks in `.husky/` (version controlled!)
- lint-staged runs tools only on staged files (super fast!)
- Your whole team gets the same hooks!
- Zero configuration for new developers! 🎉

**The workflow:**
```bash
# Developer clones repo
git clone your-repo
npm install  # Husky auto-installs hooks!

# They commit code
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
# Hooks automatically run!

# No setup needed! It just works! ✨
```

## Pro Patterns You'll Love 💎

### Pattern 1: Skip Hooks When Needed

```bash
# Sometimes you NEED to commit without running hooks
git commit --no-verify -m "WIP: work in progress"

# Or skip pre-push
git push --no-verify origin feature-branch

# Use sparingly! With great power... 🕷️
```

### Pattern 2: Conditional Checks

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Only run expensive checks on CI or when ENV var is set
if [ -n "$CI" ] || [ "$RUN_FULL_CHECKS" = "1" ]; then
  echo "🧪 Running full test suite..."
  npm test
else
  echo "⚡ Running quick checks only..."
  npm run test:changed
fi
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Execution

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run checks in parallel (faster!)
(npm run lint) &
(npm run format) &
(npm run typecheck) &

# Wait for all to complete
wait

echo "✅ All checks completed!"
```

### Pattern 4: Interactive Fixes

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

npm run lint

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Linting failed!"
  echo ""
  read -p "Run 'eslint --fix' to auto-fix? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
  echo

  if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    npm run lint:fix
    git add -u
    echo "✅ Auto-fixed! Try committing again."
  fi

  exit 1
fi
```

**User-friendly automation!** 🤝

## Common Pitfalls (Learn from My Mistakes) 🚨

### Mistake #1: Hooks Taking Forever

**Bad:**
```bash
# Running ENTIRE test suite on every commit
npm test  # Takes 5 minutes! 😭
```

**Good:**
```bash
# Run only tests for changed files
npm run test:changed  # Takes 10 seconds! ⚡
```

**Better:**
```bash
# Full tests in pre-push, quick checks in pre-commit
# pre-commit: lint, format (fast!)
# pre-push: tests (slower, but less frequent)
```

### Mistake #2: Forgetting Windows Users

**Bad:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Only works on Mac/Linux
```

**Good:**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# More portable

# Or use Node.js scripts (cross-platform!)
node scripts/pre-commit.js
```

**Better:** Use Husky! It handles cross-platform for you! 🎉

### Mistake #3: Breaking the Hooks

```bash
# If your hook script has an error, commits will fail mysteriously!

# Always test your hooks:
.git/hooks/pre-commit  # Run it manually
echo $?  # Should be 0 for success
```

### Mistake #4: Committing Without Hooks

**The trap:**
```bash
# Someone clones repo
git clone your-repo
cd your-repo

# .git/hooks is empty! No hooks installed!
# They commit without checks! 💀
```

**The fix:** Use Husky! It installs hooks automatically on `npm install`! 🎯

## Cool Tricks You Didn't Know 🎪

### Trick 1: Generate Commit Messages

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg

BRANCH_NAME=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# If branch is "feature/ABC-123-new-feature"
# Auto-add "[ABC-123]" to commit message
if [[ $BRANCH_NAME =~ ^feature/(.*) ]]; then
  TICKET="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
  echo "[$TICKET] $(cat $1)" > $1
fi
```

**Result:**
```bash
git commit -m "Add login button"
# Saved as: "[ABC-123] Add login button"

# Automatic ticket references! 🎫
```

### Trick 2: Notify on Push

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-push

# Send Slack notification
curl -X POST https://hooks.slack.com/... \
  -d "{\"text\": \"🚀 $(git config user.name) pushed to $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\"}"

# Or send desktop notification
notify-send "Git Push Complete! ✅"
```

### Trick 3: Auto-update Dependencies

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-merge

# After pulling changes, check if package.json changed
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff-tree -r --name-only --no-commit-id ORIG_HEAD HEAD)

if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep "package.json"; then
  echo "📦 package.json changed! Running npm install..."
  npm install
fi
```

**Never forget `npm install` after pulling! 🎉**
