# OAuth 2.0 Security Mistakes That'll Make You Cringe 😬🔑

**Hot take:** OAuth 2.0 is one of the most widely used — and most widely misunderstood — security protocols on the internet.

Every major platform runs on it. Google Sign-In? OAuth. "Login with GitHub"? OAuth. That Slack integration your team uses to route alerts? Yep, OAuth.

And yet, developers make the **same preventable mistakes** over and over again. Mistakes that turn your nice, secure "Sign in with Google" button into a front door with no lock. 🚪💨

I've reviewed a lot of codebases. I've seen OAuth implementations that made me want to close my laptop and become a shepherd. Let me save you from that fate.

## The Quick OAuth Refresher (For The People In The Back) 🎙️

Before we roast bad implementations, here's what a correct Authorization Code flow looks like:

```
User clicks "Login with Google"
    ↓
Your app redirects to Google's auth server
    ↓
User authenticates + approves scopes
    ↓
Google redirects BACK to your app with a short-lived `code`
    ↓
Your BACKEND exchanges `code` for an access token (never the browser!)
    ↓
You use the token to call Google's API
```

Sounds simple. Turns out there are about 11 places to screw this up. Let's hit the greatest hits. 🎵

## Mistake #1: Skipping the `state` Parameter (CSRF Bait) 🎣

**What most tutorials show:**

```javascript
// "Login with GitHub" — the naive version
app.get('/auth/github', (req, res) => {
  const authUrl = `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
    ?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}
    &redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}
    &scope=read:user`;

  res.redirect(authUrl);
});
```

**The problem:** No `state` parameter. This opens you to a **CSRF attack** where an attacker tricks your user into completing an OAuth flow that was *initiated by the attacker*. The result? The attacker's GitHub account gets linked to your user's account. Your user is now locked out. Attacker is in. 🎩

**The fix — generate and verify a `state` value:**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

app.get('/auth/github', (req, res) => {
  // Generate a random, unguessable state value
  const state = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');

  // Store it in the session BEFORE redirecting
  req.session.oauthState = state;

  const authUrl = new URL('https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize');
  authUrl.searchParams.set('client_id', CLIENT_ID);
  authUrl.searchParams.set('redirect_uri', REDIRECT_URI);
  authUrl.searchParams.set('scope', 'read:user');
  authUrl.searchParams.set('state', state);  // ✅ CSRF protection

  res.redirect(authUrl.toString());
});

app.get('/auth/callback', (req, res) => {
  const { code, state } = req.query;

  // ✅ Verify state matches what we stored
  if (!state || state !== req.session.oauthState) {
    return res.status(403).send('Invalid state parameter. Possible CSRF attack!');
  }

  // Clear state from session after use
  delete req.session.oauthState;

  // Now safely exchange the code for a token...
});
```

**Rule:** If your OAuth flow doesn't have `state`, you don't have OAuth — you have a CSRF vulnerability with a login button painted on top. 🎨

## Mistake #2: Doing the Token Exchange in the Browser 😱

**The crime scene:**

```javascript
// This is in your FRONTEND JavaScript. Dear reader, I am so sorry.
const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const code = params.get('code');

// Exchanging code for token IN THE BROWSER 💀
fetch('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    client_id: 'abc123',
    client_secret: 'my_secret_is_now_public',  // 😬
    code: code
  })
})
```

**The problem:** Your `client_secret` is now visible to anyone who opens DevTools. The entire point of the client secret is that *only your server knows it*. Once it's in browser JavaScript, it's public. Game over. An attacker can now impersonate your application entirely. 🎭

**The fix:** The code exchange happens **server-side only**. Always.

```javascript
// ✅ BACKEND route — the client_secret never leaves the server
app.get('/auth/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const { code, state } = req.query;

  // ... validate state first (see Mistake #1) ...

  const tokenResponse = await fetch('https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      client_id: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,  // ✅ Server-side env var
      code: code
    })
  });

  const { access_token } = await tokenResponse.json();

  // Store token server-side, give user a session cookie — never expose raw token
  req.session.accessToken = access_token;
  res.redirect('/dashboard');
});
```

**The golden rule:** `client_secret` lives in environment variables on your server. Full stop. No exceptions. Not even "just for testing." 🔒

## Mistake #3: Open Redirect in the `redirect_uri` 🔀

**The sneaky attack:**

```
https://yourapp.com/auth?redirect_uri=https://evil.com/steal-my-token
```

If your authorization server doesn't strictly validate the `redirect_uri` against a registered allowlist, an attacker can intercept the authorization `code` by pointing the redirect at their own server.

**How it should look in your OAuth provider settings:**

```
# Exact, registered redirect URIs (not wildcards!)
Allowed redirect URIs:
  ✅ https://yourapp.com/auth/callback
  ❌ https://yourapp.com/*
  ❌ https://*.yourapp.com/callback
  ❌ http://yourapp.com/auth/callback  (HTTP, not HTTPS)
```

**And in your code — validate it server-side too:**

```javascript
const ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS = new Set([
  'https://yourapp.com/auth/callback',
  'https://yourapp.com/auth/callback/mobile'  // If you have multiple clients
]);

app.get('/auth/start', (req, res) => {
  const redirect = req.query.redirect_uri || 'https://yourapp.com/auth/callback';

  if (!ALLOWED_REDIRECT_URIS.has(redirect)) {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid redirect URI');
  }

  // ... proceed with auth flow
});
```

**Remember:** The spec requires exact URI matching. Any flexibility you add is a vulnerability you're adding. 🎯

## Mistake #4: Using the Implicit Flow (It's Deprecated For Good Reason) 🪦

You might see old tutorials using `response_type=token`. This is the **Implicit Flow**, and it was officially deprecated in RFC 9700 because it returns the access token directly in the URL fragment.

**The dangers:**
- Access token leaks via browser history
- Access token leaks via HTTP `Referer` headers
- No way to verify the token wasn't tampered with
- Zero protection against token injection attacks

**What to use instead:**

```
# Instead of:
response_type=token  ❌ (Implicit — deprecated)

# Use:
response_type=code   ✅ (Authorization Code)

# And for public clients (mobile, SPA):
response_type=code + PKCE  ✅✅ (Authorization Code with PKCE)
```

**For SPAs and mobile apps — use PKCE:**

```javascript
// PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) — the modern way for public clients

function generatePKCE() {
  // 1. Generate a random code_verifier
  const verifier = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url');

  // 2. Hash it to create code_challenge
  const challenge = crypto.createHash('sha256')
    .update(verifier)
    .digest('base64url');

  return { verifier, challenge };
}

const { verifier, challenge } = generatePKCE();
sessionStorage.setItem('pkce_verifier', verifier);  // Store verifier

const authUrl = new URL('https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth');
authUrl.searchParams.set('response_type', 'code');
authUrl.searchParams.set('code_challenge', challenge);
authUrl.searchParams.set('code_challenge_method', 'S256');
// ... other params

// On callback, include verifier in token exchange:
// code_verifier = sessionStorage.getItem('pkce_verifier')
```

**Why PKCE works:** Even if an attacker intercepts the `code`, they can't exchange it without the `code_verifier` — which never left the client. 🔐

## Mistake #5: Storing Tokens in `localStorage` 🗄️❌

This one is so common it's practically a tradition.

```javascript
// The localStorage Hall of Shame
localStorage.setItem('access_token', token);  // ❌ XSS will steal this
localStorage.setItem('refresh_token', token); // ❌ Even worse!
```

**The problem:** Any JavaScript on your page — including third-party scripts, browser extensions, and XSS payloads — can read `localStorage`. Tokens stored there are one `document.cookie` alternative-style XSS away from being stolen.

**Better options:**

| Storage | XSS Safe | CSRF Safe | Use For |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| `localStorage` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Nothing sensitive |
| `sessionStorage` | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Short-lived, low-risk |
| `HttpOnly` Cookie | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (use SameSite) | Auth tokens ✅ |
| `HttpOnly + SameSite=Strict` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Best option |

```javascript
// ✅ Store token in HttpOnly cookie (server-side)
res.cookie('access_token', token, {
  httpOnly: true,     // JS cannot read this
  secure: true,       // HTTPS only
  sameSite: 'strict', // No cross-site sending
  maxAge: 3600000     // 1 hour
});
```

**The tradeoff:** HttpOnly cookies require CSRF protection (use `SameSite` + a CSRF token). But that's a much better problem to have than "attacker has all my users' tokens." 🛡️

## The OAuth Security Checklist You Actually Need ✅

Before shipping that "Login with GitHub" button:

```
□ state parameter generated (random, cryptographically secure)
□ state verified on callback (reject if missing or mismatched)
□ redirect_uri validated against explicit allowlist
□ code exchange happens SERVER-SIDE only
□ client_secret is in env vars, never in frontend code
□ Using Authorization Code flow (not Implicit)
□ PKCE enabled for SPAs and mobile apps
□ Access tokens NOT stored in localStorage
□ Tokens in HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
□ Scopes are minimal (only request what you need!)
□ Token expiration is enforced (short-lived access tokens)
□ Refresh tokens are rotated on use
```

If you check all of these, you're doing better than 80% of OAuth implementations in the wild. That's not me being hyperbolic — that's the result of actual audits. 😬

## The Bottom Line 💡

OAuth 2.0 is not magic. It's a protocol with sharp edges, and the spec is long for a reason. The good news is the attack surface is well-understood and the fixes are not complicated — they just require you to actually read the spec (or at least this blog post).

**The three things that'll save you 90% of the pain:**
1. Always use and verify the `state` parameter
2. Never touch `client_secret` in the browser
3. Use Authorization Code + PKCE and HttpOnly cookies

OAuth done right is genuinely great. OAuth done wrong is a phishing-as-a-service platform you accidentally built yourself. 🙃

**Want to see these patterns in real code?** Check out [GitHub](https://github.com/kpanuragh) for working OAuth examples with PKCE and proper state handling.

*Now go lock down those OAuth flows — your users' accounts are counting on you!* 🔑🔒✨

**P.S.** If you're using a library like Passport.js, NextAuth, or Laravel Socialite — read the docs for the `state` parameter. Most libraries support it but don't enable it by default. Classic. 🙄
