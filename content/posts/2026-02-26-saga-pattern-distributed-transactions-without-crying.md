# The Saga Pattern: Distributed Transactions Without Crying Yourself to Sleep 🎭😭

**True story:** It was 11 PM on a Tuesday when our Slack blew up.

Customer support: *"Users are being charged but orders aren't showing up!"*

Me: *"That's... not supposed to happen."*

DevOps: *"Payment service is up. Inventory service... crashed 40 minutes ago."*

Me: 😱

We had successfully charged 23 customers for orders that existed nowhere. Payment had committed. Inventory had failed. And we had absolutely no rollback plan. Welcome to the distributed transaction hell — the problem the **Saga Pattern** exists to solve.

## The Problem: Distributed Transactions Don't Exist 🤦

In a monolith with a single database, life is beautiful:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user_id = 42;
  INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total) VALUES (42, 100);
  UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = 7;
COMMIT;  -- All or nothing! ✅
-- (or)
ROLLBACK; -- Like it never happened! ✅
```

One database. One transaction. Either everything works or nothing does. Pure magic.

**In microservices, you get this:**

```
User clicks "Buy Now"
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  Order Svc  │ ← Creates order (committed to OrderDB)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Payment Svc │ ← Charges card (committed to PaymentDB)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│Inventory Svc│ ← CRASHES 💥 (InventoryDB unreachable)
└─────────────┘

Result: Order created ✅, Payment charged ✅, Inventory NOT updated ❌
```

There's no magic `ROLLBACK` across 3 independent databases. You need a strategy. That strategy is the **Saga**.

## What Even Is a Saga? 📖

A Saga is a sequence of local transactions where **each step has a compensating transaction** — basically an "undo" action that reverses the previous step if something downstream fails.

```
Forward steps (happy path):
1. Create Order      → Compensate: Cancel Order
2. Charge Payment    → Compensate: Refund Payment
3. Reserve Inventory → Compensate: Release Inventory
4. Notify Customer   → Compensate: Send Cancellation Email

If step 3 fails:
→ Run compensate(step 2): Refund Payment
→ Run compensate(step 1): Cancel Order
→ Customer gets a refund email instead of a ghost order ✅
```

Think of it like a Vegas heist plan. Everyone has their role, and if the vault alarm goes off mid-job, everyone knows the abort sequence. No one stands around saying "well, I already picked the lock, so..." 🎰

## Implementation #1: Choreography-Based Saga (Event-Driven) 🎼

Each service does its job and publishes an event. Other services listen and react. No one's in charge — it's a jazz band, not an orchestra.

```
┌─────────────┐
│  Order Svc  │──publishes──▶ order.created
└─────────────┘
                                    │
                    ┌───────────────┘
                    ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Payment Svc │ listens to order.created
│             │──publishes──▶ payment.completed (or payment.failed)
└─────────────┘
                                    │
                    ┌───────────────┘
                    ▼
┌─────────────┐
│Inventory Svc│ listens to payment.completed
│             │──publishes──▶ inventory.reserved (or inventory.failed)
└─────────────┘
```

**When designing our e-commerce backend**, I started with choreography because it looked simpler. It wasn't. Here's what the Node.js code actually looks like:

```javascript
// order-service/src/handlers/createOrder.js
async function createOrder(orderData) {
    // Step 1: Create the order locally
    const order = await db.orders.create({
        userId: orderData.userId,
        productId: orderData.productId,
        status: 'PENDING',  // NOT 'CONFIRMED' yet!
        total: orderData.total
    });

    // Publish event — don't wait for payment!
    await eventBus.publish('order.created', {
        orderId: order.id,
        userId: order.userId,
        total: order.total,
        productId: order.productId
    });

    return order;
}

// Compensating transaction (called if payment fails)
async function cancelOrder(orderId) {
    await db.orders.update(orderId, { status: 'CANCELLED' });
    await eventBus.publish('order.cancelled', { orderId });
}
```

```javascript
// payment-service/src/handlers/paymentHandler.js
eventBus.subscribe('order.created', async (event) => {
    try {
        const payment = await chargeCustomer({
            userId: event.userId,
            amount: event.total,
            orderId: event.orderId
        });

        await eventBus.publish('payment.completed', {
            orderId: event.orderId,
            paymentId: payment.id
        });
    } catch (error) {
        // Compensate! Tell Order Service to cancel.
        await eventBus.publish('payment.failed', {
            orderId: event.orderId,
            reason: error.message
        });
    }
});

// Order service listens for payment.failed
eventBus.subscribe('payment.failed', async (event) => {
    await cancelOrder(event.orderId);  // Compensating transaction!
    await notifyUser(event.orderId, 'Payment failed, order cancelled');
});
```

**The catch with choreography:**

- ✅ Services are loosely coupled
- ✅ No single point of failure
- ✅ Easy to add new services
- ⚠️ Hard to visualize the full flow
- ⚠️ Debugging is a detective game across 5 services' logs
- ⚠️ Cyclic dependencies creep in silently
- ⚠️ *"Which service handles this edge case?"* — nobody knows

**A scalability lesson that cost us:** We had a bug where `inventory.failed` triggered `payment.refund`, which published `payment.refunded`, which triggered `order.cancelled`, which published `order.cancelled`, which triggered... a loop. Events firing forever. At 3 AM. Fun times. 🔄💸

## Implementation #2: Orchestration-Based Saga (Central Coordinator) 🎯

One service — the **Saga Orchestrator** — tells everyone what to do. Think of it as a project manager: it knows every step, decides who does what, and handles rollbacks when things go sideways.

```
          ┌──────────────────────┐
          │   Order Orchestrator │
          └──────────┬───────────┘
                     │
         ┌───────────┼───────────┐
         ▼           ▼           ▼
   [Create Order] [Charge $] [Reserve Stock]
         │           │           │
         │     if fails:         │
         │    ◄────────          │
         │   Refund $            │
         ◄──────────────────────
      Cancel Order
```

Here's what the orchestrator looks like in Node.js:

```javascript
// saga/checkoutSaga.js
class CheckoutSaga {
    constructor(sagaId, orderData) {
        this.sagaId = sagaId;
        this.orderData = orderData;
        this.steps = [];
        this.currentStep = 0;
    }

    async execute() {
        try {
            // Step 1: Create Order
            const order = await this.createOrder();
            this.steps.push({ name: 'createOrder', data: order });

            // Step 2: Process Payment
            const payment = await this.processPayment(order);
            this.steps.push({ name: 'processPayment', data: payment });

            // Step 3: Reserve Inventory
            const reservation = await this.reserveInventory(order);
            this.steps.push({ name: 'reserveInventory', data: reservation });

            // Step 4: Confirm Order (all good!)
            await this.confirmOrder(order.id);

            return { success: true, orderId: order.id };

        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Saga ${this.sagaId} failed at step: ${error.step}`);
            await this.compensate();  // Run undo operations
            throw error;
        }
    }

    async compensate() {
        // Run compensating transactions in REVERSE order
        for (const step of this.steps.reverse()) {
            try {
                await this.runCompensation(step);
            } catch (compensationError) {
                // Log but continue - compensation must complete!
                console.error(`Compensation failed for ${step.name}:`, compensationError);
                await this.alertOps(step.name, compensationError);
            }
        }
    }

    async runCompensation(step) {
        switch (step.name) {
            case 'createOrder':
                await orderService.cancel(step.data.id);
                break;
            case 'processPayment':
                await paymentService.refund(step.data.paymentId);
                break;
            case 'reserveInventory':
                await inventoryService.release(step.data.reservationId);
                break;
        }
    }
}

// Usage
const saga = new CheckoutSaga(uuid(), { userId, productId, total });
const result = await saga.execute();
```

**As a Technical Lead, I've learned:** Orchestration wins for complex flows. It's easier to debug, monitor, and reason about. The orchestrator is the single source of truth for what's happening.

**Trade-offs vs Choreography:**

| | Choreography | Orchestration |
|--|--|--|
| Coupling | Loose | Tighter |
| Debugging | Nightmare 😭 | Easier 😌 |
| Visibility | Scattered | Centralized |
| Single point of failure | No | Yes (orchestrator) |
| Adding new steps | Complex | Straightforward |

## The Compensating Transaction Trap 🪤

Here's the thing nobody tells you about compensation: **it can fail too**.

```javascript
// This can happen:
async function compensate() {
    await orderService.cancel(orderId);    // ✅ Works
    await paymentService.refund(paymentId); // 💥 Stripe is down!
    await inventoryService.release(reservationId); // Never reached
}

// Now you have: Cancelled order + No refund + Locked inventory
// Congrats, you have a new problem!
```

**The fix — Idempotent compensations with retry:**

```javascript
// saga/sagaStore.js — Persist saga state!
async function saveSagaState(sagaId, state) {
    await db.sagas.upsert({
        id: sagaId,
        state: JSON.stringify(state),
        updatedAt: new Date()
    });
}

// Retry compensation until it succeeds
async function compensateWithRetry(step, maxRetries = 5) {
    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
        try {
            await runCompensation(step);
            return;  // Success!
        } catch (error) {
            if (attempt === maxRetries) {
                // Alert a human! Manual intervention needed.
                await alertOpsTeam({
                    sagaId: this.sagaId,
                    failedStep: step.name,
                    error: error.message,
                    priority: 'P0'  // Wake someone up!
                });
                return;
            }
            // Exponential backoff
            await sleep(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000);
        }
    }
}
```

**When designing our e-commerce backend**, we stored every saga state in a database. If the orchestrator crashed mid-saga, it could resume from where it left off. Without this, you're flying blind.

## Common Saga Mistakes I've Made 😅

### Mistake #1: Treating Compensation Like a Rollback

A database rollback is instant and total. Compensation is **not**. The payment was already charged. The email was already sent. You're compensating, not time-traveling.

```
❌ Wrong mindset: "Compensation undoes everything perfectly"
✅ Right mindset: "Compensation corrects the business state"

// Email was sent? Compensation sends another email saying "sorry, cancelled!"
// Money was charged? Compensation issues a refund (takes 3-5 business days)
```

### Mistake #2: Non-Idempotent Compensations

Network retries mean your compensation might run twice. If it charges a refund twice... you're now paying customers to shop with you. 🤑

```javascript
// ❌ Bad - charges refund twice if called twice
async function refund(paymentId, amount) {
    await stripe.refunds.create({ payment_intent: paymentId, amount });
}

// ✅ Good - idempotent, safe to call multiple times
async function refund(paymentId, amount, idempotencyKey) {
    await stripe.refunds.create({
        payment_intent: paymentId,
        amount,
        idempotency_key: idempotencyKey  // Stripe ignores duplicates!
    });
}
```

### Mistake #3: Forgetting Saga Timeout

What if a step hangs forever? The saga just... waits. Forever. Locking resources indefinitely.

```javascript
// Always set timeouts!
const payment = await Promise.race([
    paymentService.charge(order),
    timeout(30_000, `Payment timed out for saga ${this.sagaId}`)
]);
```

## When to Use the Saga Pattern 🤔

**Use Saga when:**
- You have multiple services that need to work together atomically
- You're doing e-commerce checkout, booking systems, bank transfers
- You need "eventually consistent" transactions across services
- You can't use a distributed database (2-phase commit is slow and fragile)

**Don't use Saga when:**
- You have a monolith with one database (just use a DB transaction!)
- Your operations are read-only (no writes = no saga needed)
- The business can tolerate "partial success" (some use cases can!)
- You're just overcomplicating a simple CRUD app

**As a Technical Lead, I've learned:** Sagas add complexity. Don't use them because they're cool — use them because your business logic genuinely requires cross-service atomicity.

(Not a ghost charge!) 🎉
```

## TL;DR 🏁

- **Distributed transactions don't exist** — each service commits locally
- **Saga Pattern** = sequence of steps + compensating transactions for rollback
- **Choreography** = services react to events (loosely coupled, hard to debug)
- **Orchestration** = central coordinator (easier to reason about, harder to scale)
- **Always persist saga state** — crashes happen, your saga should survive them
- **Idempotent compensations** — retries WILL happen, write for it
- **Set timeouts** — don't let a hanging service lock your resources forever

The night our inventory service crashed and charged 23 customers for nothing? That was 3 years ago. We built the Saga Pattern into our checkout the next week. We've had service crashes since — many times. Not one customer has been incorrectly charged since. 🎉

The Saga Pattern won't make distributed systems simple. Nothing will. But it gives you a structured way to fail gracefully, compensate correctly, and sleep through the night. ☕

**P.S.** The hardest part of the Saga Pattern isn't the code — it's explaining to your product manager why the refund takes 3-5 business days but the charge was instant. Some things can't be compensated for with code. 💳😅
